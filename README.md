## Notes

This is my first experience ever with PHP. Because of this there was a lot of time spent actually getting things to display the way I wanted to. 

For the custom tip percentage functionality I originally started with a radio button and had it fully functioning. However, from a users perspective I think it makes more sense to have a checkbox. A possible alternative would be to use Javascript to make the static and custom tip percentages appear mutually exclusive.
